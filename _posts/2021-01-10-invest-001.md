To minimize losses and volatility, it is paramount in your investment.

# Characteristics of Investment
## Multiplication, not addition
When the first and second period returns are as follows, what is the cumulative return?
```
CASE1: +50%, -50%
CASE2: +50%, +50%
CASE3: -50%, -50%
```

[X] Addition
```
+50% + -50% = 0%
+50% + +50% = +100%
-50% + -50% = -100%
```

[O] Multiplication
```
(1 + +50%) * (1 + -50%) - 1 = -25%
(1 + +50%) * (1 + +50%) - 1 = +125%
(1 + -50%) * (1 + -50%) - 1 = -75%
```
**The cumulative return is multiplication, not addition**

## Asymmetry of profit and loss
What is the rate of return required to recover the principal in case of loss?
```
CASE1: -10%
CASE2: -20%
CASE3: -30%
CASE4: -40%
CASE5: -50%
CASE6: -60%
CASE7: -70%
CASE8: -80%
CASE9: -90%
```
```
1 / (1 + -10%) - 1 = +11%
1 / (1 + -20%) - 1 = +25%
1 / (1 + -30%) - 1 = +43%
1 / (1 + -40%) - 1 = +67%
1 / (1 + -50%) - 1 = +100%
1 / (1 + -60%) - 1 = +150%
1 / (1 + -70%) - 1 = +233%
1 / (1 + -80%) - 1 = +400%
1 / (1 + -90%) - 1 = +900%
```
**It is important to minimize losses**

## Loss of volatility
When the first and second period returns are as follows, what is the cumulative return?
```
CASE1: +10%, -10%
CASE2: +20%, -20%
CASE3: +30%, -30%
CASE4: +40%, -40%
CASE5: +50%, -50%
CASE6: +60%, -60%
CASE7: +70%, -70%
CASE8: +80%, -80%
CASE9: +90%, -90%
```
```
(1 + +10%) * (1 + -10%) - 1 = -1%
(1 + +20%) * (1 + -20%) - 1 = -4%
(1 + +30%) * (1 + -30%) - 1 = -9%
(1 + +40%) * (1 + -40%) - 1 = -16%
(1 + +50%) * (1 + -50%) - 1 = -25%
(1 + +60%) * (1 + -60%) - 1 = -36%
(1 + +70%) * (1 + -70%) - 1 = -49%
(1 + +80%) * (1 + -80%) - 1 = -64%
(1 + +90%) * (1 + -90%) - 1 = -81%
```
